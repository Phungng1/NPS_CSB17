1. Function
- A series of code used to accomplish something
- 2 types:
    + Built-in functions: print(), append(), remove(), input()...
    + Functions written by user

- Syntax: 
def function_name(valueables):
    statement

2. Valueable's scope
- global: valueable created outside of a function, saved and used in the entire program 
- local: valueable created inside of a function, used only in the function, disappear after the function ends

3. Distinguish print and return
- return: 
    + Return only 1 value (valueable, list...)
    + If there is no 'return' keyword, the function will return
    + When the 'return' keyword is call, the function immediately stop, the code behind 'return' will not work

4. Change function to module + import module
- Module: 
    + Quite similar to funciton
    + Help organise the source code logically, easier to
